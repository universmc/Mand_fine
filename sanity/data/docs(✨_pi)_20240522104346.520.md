Sure, here's an example of how you might initialize a Sanity client in JavaScript:
```javascript
const sanityClient = require('@sanity/client')

const client = sanityClient({
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  dataset: 'your-dataset-name',
  useCdn: true // this enables the built-in CDN for faster performance
})
```
Make sure to replace `'your-project-id'` and `'your-dataset-name'` with your actual project ID and dataset name, which you can find in the Sanity Studio dashboard.

The `useCdn` option is set to `true` by default, which means that the client will use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve your content, making it faster for your users to access. However, if you need to make real-time updates or write data to your Sanity project, you should set `useCdn` to `false`.
